    <h1>Description of Changes</h1></br>
The differences between these images are subtle, which is strange considering there is a large difference in time between each image. Regarding the pages containing only two images, the images are from 2005 and 2020; regarding the pages containing three images, the images are from 2005, 2010, and 2020. This total covered area did not change much at all, but there were a few minute infrastructure changes. One of them is easily visible in the buttons page, where we can see that there was some sort of pool or lake that was constructed in the middle of the park since 2005. Other than that change, other minute changes include new roads, widening of roads, and some small differences in the various harbors surrounding the bay. This area was already heavily urbanized in 2005, so it makes sense that not much as a whole has changed; if we wanted to see a larger change there would have needed to be some major construction in the past fifteen years or so.
